##Open

A tiny version of Mac's open for Windows. [Download It](https://github.com/benkiefer/open/releases/tag/0.0.1), put it on your path, and you're good to go.

###Usage

Open a file or directory:

    open test.txt
     
Open a file in your editor:

	open -e test.txt

If you want to use an editor other than Notepad, set your EDITOR environment variable. If it's not on your PATH, make sure you use the full path to the EDITOR variable.
